Lab Exercise 0: Introduction to C, Git, and the MSP430

This repository provides two files that include a header and code file. The purpose is this code is to provide a function that allows the user to perform several mathematical operations on two integers and returns the value. In order to use these mathematical operations, the math (library) The variable used to distinguish between mathematical operations is called "Operator" and uses mathematical symbols as the variable. For example, to add two integers, the user would input a "+" into the function call where the designated Operator argument is listed. The format for the function call is (Integer 1, Integer 2, Operator Symbol). Some other mathematical operations that this repository gives a user access to is subtraction, division, multiplication, modulus, bit wise AND, bit wise, OR, bit wise XOR, and negation of integer 1.
